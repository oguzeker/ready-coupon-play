== * * *Please note that `Ready-Coupon-Play` is currently deployed to the cloud in the form of a `Docker Swarm` cluster.*

You can directly access individual components of the cluster through the links in the <<components, Components>> section.

== Summary

This is a demo project implemented for `*Bilyoner*` interview rounds of *2020*. This is a just simple betting coupon sales application implemented only for demonstation purposes.

The application generates `ready-made` coupons in accordance with the predefined gaming rules by using the events registered in the system. Users can list ready coupons and play or cancel them.

== Motivation

This application is implemented to manage betting coupon operations and to arrange user balance updates.

== Code style

This project uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[`Model-View-Controller`] pattern for the directory structure and resposibility distribution among layers of abstraction.

We deliberately chose not to employ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-control-boundary[`Entity-Control-Boundary`] pattern for practicality.

== Tech/framework used

Project was built with the following technologies:

- https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[Java 11]
- https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring-Boot]
- https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Eureka-at-a-glance[Eureka Service Discovery]
- https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2 Database Engine]
- https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]
- https://www.docker.com/[Docker]

Please make sure that you have your local environment set up properly before installation and use.

== Installation

To build and run the application, you need to separately run the following commands at the root directory of the project:

 mvn install

 docker-compose up -d

After that, run the following command to check and see the docker containers running in the background.

  docker ps

== Basic Flow

On startup, the application populates the database with dummy data so as to make the demo application easier to test. Still, you can manually perform actions through the `Rest API`.

== Components[[components]]

This application comprises of *three* main components. *You can directly check each one of them via these links:*

. http://68.183.53.25:9090/balances/1[`balance-api`]
. http://68.183.53.25:9091/events/1[`coupon-api`]

=== Scalability & Replication

`Ready-Coupon-Play` is currently deployed to the cloud in the form of a `Docker Swarm` cluster.

The swarm cluster consists of two nodes with the IPs below:

 68.183.53.25

 142.93.65.102

`balance-api` and `coupon-api` are scaled up to only *one* replica for now. This is because we did not utilize a distributed database architecture (at least single separate DB instances per each service) for this demo application.

To check service instances inside the cluster, please go to http://68.183.53.25:8761[`bilyoner-eureka-discovery`]
